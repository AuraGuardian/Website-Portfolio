						<b> What is it that you do and what can you offer my company? </b> <br><br>
								
									I am a Quant, pursuing my <b>Masters in Quantitative Finance</b> at <b>Rutgers Business School.</b> <br>
								
									Having taken relevant courses in my Master's, 
									I have developed excellent <b>programming skills</b>  that form the Quant/Data Scientist job's core coding languages. <a href="generic.html" > (Technical Skills Section) </a> <br>
								
									Being excellent at <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b>, I am great at developing <b>Financial Models</b> (Pricing, Time Series, etc.) 
									along with insights in <b>Financial Instruments</b> (Derivatives, Fixed Incomes, ETFs, etc.), which is essential to work as a Quant <a href="resume.html"> (WebRésumé) </a> <br><br>
								
									I have done my undergrad in <b>IIT Bombay Chemical Engineering</b>, having been selected in the <b>top 0.07 % ile</b> of JEE Examination, 
									which shows excellent <b> problem-solving ability</b> which very few others have <br> 
								
									Along with my Masters, I want to be a <b>Fellow</b> member of the <b>Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</b> and a <b>Charter Holder</b> from the <b>CFA Institute</b>. 
									Studying for these has given me insights into <b>Concepts, Ethics, and Laws</b> relating to the <b>Finance and Insurance Profession.</b> <br>

									To add to it, I have the quality of <b>explaining programming and statistical insights to non-technical audiences</b> through Tableau. I am also good at communicating with co-workers, 
									which I have shown many times while teaching programming languages to people at my workplace while working at Tata AIG. <br>
								
									<b>I am interested in Finance and Insurance Industry's roles as a Quantitative and/or Actuarial Data Scientist roles for which I can start immediately.</b> <br>
								
									As a determined and motivated individual, I can positively impact the company that I will be a part of. <br>
							
								</p>
							
								<p>
								
									<b> What is unique about you, what is the extra can you give to my company? </b> <br><br>

									With my <b>well-rounded knowledge</b> of the processes in Quant Finance, I can be of great help to all the members of the Team <br>
								
									Being a <b>Fast Learner</b>, it won't take much time for me to be up and running for the company <br>
								
									Usually, Quants are assumed to be "Shy" and cannot explain their work well to non-technical audiences. 
									I, as a Quant, want to break that notion among naysayers! 
									I have <b>excellent presentation skills</b> that I <b>tailor according to my audiences</b> and always <b>"Keep it Fun."</b><br>
									

								</p>

								<p>
								
									<b> How do you add to the Team? </b> <br><br>

									I can act as a <b>bridge</b> between technical and non-technical teammates with my capability to <b>talk rocket-science in straightforward layman terms</b>. 
									(See my blogs) <br>
								
									I am great at <b>discussions</b> ranging from sports to pop culture to memes, apart from Quant stuff, basically anything under the sun. 
									I can thus add value to my Team. <br>
								
									I am passionate about what I do, and being a fast learner it won't take time for me to mix in the Team and start working ASAP. 
									Also, having worked with my fellow batchmates in a 'WFH' semester and still making things work, <b>"The New Normal" isn't a big concern for me</b> <br>
															
									Also, being aware of the <b>"Connection Culture,"</b> I always <b>add positive value</b> to any Team. <br>


								</p>

								<p>
								
									<b> What is it that you seek from the company? </b> <br><br>

									If the job environment <b>rewards Innovation and Thinking out of the Box</b>, I'd be more than happy to work for you. <br>
								
									A <b>challenging work environment</b> gets the best out of me, so I expect the job to be <b>intriguing as well as interesting</b> <br>
								
									<b>Teammates</b> who bring the best out of you <br>
															

								</p>
								
								<p>
								
									<b> What are your favourite movies? </b> <br><br>
									
									I have <b>no particular preferences</b> and have selected my top 10 list of movies from <b>different actors, eras and genres</b>:<br>
									1. The Terminator 2	| 2. Predator | 3. Commando | 4. The Terminator | 5. Kindergarten Cop <br>
									6. Twins | 7. Total Recall | 8. Last Action Hero | 9. Conan the Barbarian | 10. The Running Man
