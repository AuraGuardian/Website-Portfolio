							<div class="inner">
								<p>  
																
									<b> What is it that you do? and what can you offer my company? </b> <br><br>
									
									<!--What and So What-->							
									I am a Quant, pursuing my <b>Masters in Quantitative Finance</b> at <b>Rutgers Business School.</b> <br>
									An Investment in Knowledge pays the best interest undoubtebly, as it is said. <br>
								
									Having taken relevant courses in my Master's degree, 
									
									I have developed amazing <b>programming skills</b> that form the Quant/Data Scientist job's core coding languages. <a href="generic.html" > (Technical Skills Section) </a> <br>
								
									Being excellent at <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b>, I am great at developing <b>Financial and Risk Management Models</b> (Pricing, Time Series, etc.) 
									along with insights in <b>Financial Instruments</b> (Derivatives, Fixed Incomes, ETFs, etc.), which are essential to work as a Quant. <br>
									<a href="resume.html"> (WebRésumé) </a> <br>
								
									I have done my undergrad in <b>IIT Bombay Chemical Engineering</b>, having been selected in the <b>top 0.07 %ile</b> of JEE Examination out of a <b>1.3M</b> other students, 
									which shows excellent <b>problem-solving ability</b> which a very few others have <br> 
								
									Along with my Masters, I want to be a <b>Fellow member</b> of the <b>Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</b> and a <b>Charter Holder</b> from the <b>CFA Institute</b>. 
									Studying for these has given me insights into <b>Concepts, Ethics, Regualtions and Laws</b> relating to the <b>Finance and Insurance Profession.</b> <br>

									To add to it, I have the quality of <b>explaining programming and statistical insights to non-technical audiences</b> through Tableau. I am also good at communicating with co-workers, 
									which I have shown many times while teaching programming languages to people at my workplace while working at Tata AIG. <br>
									
									<!--Now What-->
									As a Quant my above described advanced skills in <b>Math, Statistics, Programming, Risk Management, Data Science, and Actuarial Science,</b> to name a few
									coupled with Astute <b>Decision-Making, Innovation and Problem-Solving</b> will make an significant contribution to the Firm's Alpha.

									<b> I am interested in Finance and Insurance Industry's roles as a Quantitative and/or Actuarial Data Scientist roles for which I can start immediately.</b> <br>
								
									As a determined and motivated individual, I can positively impact the company that I will be a part of. <br>
							
								</p>
							
								<p>
								
									<b> What is unique about you, what is the extra can you give to my company? </b> <br><br>
									
									<!--What and So What-->
									
									A massive <b>87% of the AI and Data Science projects</b> with similar numbers in specifically Quantitative Models
									don't make it into production significantly due to <b>ESG, Regulation and Data Privacy concerns</b>.
									Thus, wasting important resources and time of the Firm.<br>
									
									<!--Now What-->
									
									With my <b>well-rounded knowledge</b> of the established and the upcoming like <b>ESG, Regulations, Cryptocurrency, Data Privacy, BASEL III, GRI, 
									Cybersecurity</b> to name a few I can deliver the required results on time without a fuss<br>
									
									<!--What and So What-->
									
									Usually,<b>  Quants are assumed to be "Shy"</b>  and cannot explain their work well to non-technical audiences, thus leading to <b> poor communications.</b>  <br>
									
									<!--Now What-->
									
									I, as a Quant, want to break that notion among naysayers! having <b>excellent Data Visualization and Presentation skills</b> 
									that I <b>tailor according to my audiences</b> to always <b>"Keep it Fun."</b><br>
									

								</p>

								<p>
								
									<b> How do you add to the Team? </b> <br>
									
									<!--What and So What-->
									It is a known that one Half of your returns is determined by your investments, the other half by what kind of a person you are. 
									A <b> good teammate </b> adds to the <b> connection culture </b> and thus improves the <b> productivity</b>  of to the team significantly<br>
									
									<!--Now What-->
									I can act as a <b>bridge</b> between technical and non-technical teammates with my capability to <b>talk rocket-science in straightforward layman terms</b>. 
									(See my Blogs) and improving the Productivity of the Team and thus the Organisation<br>
								
									Being an <b> outgoing person</b> ,
									I am great at discussions ranging from sports to pop culture to memes, apart from Quant stuff, basically anything under the sun, 
									adding to the Connection among the teammates<br>
								
									I am passionate about what I do, 
									and being a <b>fast learner</b> it won't take time for me to mix in with the Team and start making a difference A.S.A.P.. 
									Also, having worked with my fellow batchmates in a 'WFH' semester at Rutgers and still making things work, 
									<b>"The New Normal" isn't a big concern for me</b> <br>
															
									Being aware of the <b>"Connection Culture,"</b> I strive to always <b>add positive value</b> to any Team I am a part of. <br>


								</p>

								<p>
									
									<b> What is it that you seek from the company? </b> <br><br>
									
									<!--What and So What-->

									As someone wanting to be the best Quant I only expect a environment where I can thrive to better my skills and in-turn do wonders for 
									the firm I work for!<br>

									<!--Now What-->
									If the job environment <b>rewards Innovation and an Out of the Box thinking</b>, I'd be more than happy to work for you. <br>
								
									A <b>challenging work environment</b> gets the best out of me, so I expect the job to be <b>intriguing as well as interesting</b> <br>
								
									<b>Teammates</b> who bring the best out of you<br>
														

								</p>
								
								<p>
								
									<b> What are your favourite movies? </b> <br><br>
									
									I have <b>no particular preferences</b> and have selected my top 10 list of movies from <b>different actors, eras and genres</b>:<br>
									1. The Terminator 2	| 2. Predator | 3. Commando | 4. The Terminator | 5. Kindergarten Cop <br>
									6. Twins | 7. Total Recall | 8. Last Action Hero | 9. Conan the Barbarian | 10. The Running Man
